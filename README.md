# EEGNet

Implementation of EEGNet in PyTorch.

EEGNet is convolutional neural network proposed by Vernon J. Lawhern in the paper called **EEGNet: A Compact Convolutional Network for EEG-based Brain-Computer Interfaces**. As the name suggest is a convolutional network for EEG-based data.
The original paper can be read on [ArXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.08024) or [iopscience](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1741-2552/aace8c)
